# Multi-sig-wallet
My Codigo Dev Quest Application.
I programmed the Multi signature wallet in the Rust programming language and simplified it to just two files, one for the main script and the other for the unit tests. 
The code should satisfy all the conditions as stated in the requirements section. I tried using the Codigo AI, it was effective but since I am more conversant with Rust I opted out from it.
The Codigo AI was very user friendly and interactive, I will try to be more used to typing in TypeScript as the Codigo AI is very helpful especially in creating the entire project's workspace.
